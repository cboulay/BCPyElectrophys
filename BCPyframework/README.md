This file attempts to make BCPy2000 compatible with newer versions of IPython + pyreadline.
Doing so would enable BCPy2000 to work with 64-bit Python or newer versions of Python (e.g. 2.7).

To use:
Copy this file into `BCI2000/src/contrib/BCPy2000/framework/BCPy2000` before installing the framework
